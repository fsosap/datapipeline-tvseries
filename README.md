# datapipeline tvseries

Development of a short project to ETL from a REST API to a SQLite database

data ingestion is modeled as follows. Please check it out for better understanding of the code.

To install this project you can follow the following steps:
-- previous requierements:
make sure you have already installed python and its version is the same or higher than mine:

```text
Python 3.9.6
```

also consider the need for having installed git on your system

```text
git version 2.39.2
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è INSTALLING STEPS

1. copy the current repository into your system with

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fsosap/datapipeline-tvseries.git
    ```

2. create a virtual environment to run the project and avoid downloads on your global python environment

    ```bash
    python -m venv <venv_name>
    ```

3. activate your virtual environment so you can start downloading packages

    ```bash
    # for UNIX based systems
    source <venv_name>/bin/activate

    # for windows users
    C:\> <venv_name>\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

4. download the dependencies from 'requirements.txt' file with the following command

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. run the code with

    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

## üêã Docker support

This project supports running in a Docker container for easy deployment and isolation. Follow the steps below to run the project using Docker.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

- [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Docker Configuration

1. Clone the current repository into your system:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fsosap/datapipeline-tvseries.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd datapipeline-tvseries
    ```

3. Build and run the project using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
# Or use
docker compose up --build -d
```

Docker Compose will create a Docker container for your project and mount volumes for data storage and the SQLite database.

### Running the Program

To run the program within the Docker container, follow these steps:

1. Start the Docker container in detached mode (as we did earlier):
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
# Or use
docker compose up --build -d
```

2. Execute the program within the container:
```bash
docker-compose exec app python src/main.py
# Or use
docker compose exec app python src/main.py
```

### Environment Variables

You can customize the behavior of the program by using environment variables. The following variables are supported:

- `START_DATE`: Specify the start date for data extraction (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
- `END_DATE`: Specify the end date for data extraction (format: YYYY-MM-DD).

If you do not provide values for these environment variables, the program will prompt you for input during execution. You can leave them empty or unset to use the default values.

### Managing Data

- Downloaded data files will be stored in the `data/` directory within the project.
- The SQLite database will be stored in the `db/` directory within the project.

By using volumes, data and database changes will persist even if the Docker container is stopped or removed.

### Additional Configuration

Make sure that your project code correctly references the paths within the container for data storage and database operations as defined in the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files.

Feel free to customize the `.dockerignore` file to exclude any project-specific files or directories you don't want to include in the Docker image.
